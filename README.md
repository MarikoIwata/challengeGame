# challengeGame
Vanilla Javascript game that asks you questions and tracks your score

This game was born out of a group project at CS Prep. There is more that we can add to it, so I'm putting it on github to list out some of the issues it has and work on developing this game to be better while also challenging myself with vanilla javascript.

## Milestones

- Higher order functions are used so that we didn't have to repeat the code for each question that popped up


## Goals
- [ ] learn how to make issues on git to list out all that can happen for this game
- [ ] upgrade the game
